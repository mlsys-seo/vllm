Prompt: 'The future of AI is', Generated text: " here, and it’s coming to a job near you\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is no longer the stuff of sci-fi movies. It’s real, it’s happening now, and it’s going to change our lives in ways we can barely imagine right now. But what does that mean for the future of work? How will AI impact jobs across industries? And how can workers prepare themselves for this new era of automation?\nTo find out more about these questions — as well as how companies are using AI today — I recently sat down with Andrew Ng, cofounder and chief scientist at Baidu Deep Learning Institute (Baidu DLI), one of the world's leading deep learning research institutes. Here are some highlights from our conversation:\nWhat is artificial intelligence really all about?\nAndrew Ng: Artificial intelligence has been around since 1950 or so when Alan Turing published his famous paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence.” What he was trying to do was figure out if machines could think like humans do; whether they would be able to pass the Turing test by fooling people into thinking they were human beings on a phone call or something like that. Since then there have been many breakthroughs in"
