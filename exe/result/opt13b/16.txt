Prompt: 'The future of AI is', Generated text: ' here\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is no longer the stuff of science fiction. It’s real, it’s happening now and it’s going to have a profound impact on how we live our lives in the years ahead. But what exactly is AI? How does it work? And why should you care about this new technology? Here are five things you need to know about artificial intelligence:\n1. What Is Artificial Intelligence?\nThe term “artificial intelligence” was coined in 1956 by computer scientist John McCarthy at a conference held at Dartmouth College. He defined AI as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computers that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making under uncertainty or control of robots and autonomous vehicles.” Since then there has been an explosion of research into developing machine learning algorithms capable of mimicking some aspects of human thought processes—a process known as artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n2. Why Do We Need Artificial Intelligence Now More Than Ever Before?'
