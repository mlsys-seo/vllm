But it’s still not as bad as former Presidents George W. Bush or Bill Clinton were at this point in their presidencies (Bush had an approval rating of 41 percent and a disapproval rate of 56 percent; Clinton had an approval rate 42 percent and a 57-percent disapproval rate).\n\nIn fact, no president since World War II has been less popular during his first year in office than Trump is now:'

Prompt: 'The future of AI is', Generated text: ' here\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been around for decades, but it’s only in the last few years that we’ve started to see its impact on our daily lives. From self-driving cars to virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, AI is everywhere — even if you don’t realize it. But what does the future of AI look like? And how will this technology affect your life? Here are a few things you need to know about artificial intelligence. View As: One Page Slides\nWhat is artificial intelligence? The term "artificial intelligence" was coined by computer scientist John McCarthy at Dartmouth College in 1956, according to MIT Technology Review. It\'s defined as "the ability of a machine or system to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence." In other words, machines can think and learn just like humans do.\nHow does artificial intelligence work? There are two main types of machine learning algorithms: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning involves feeding data into an algorithm so that it can recognize patterns over time and make predictions based on those patterns alone without any additional input from humans or other sources of information. Unsupervised learning works in much the same way; however, instead of relying solely on past data points'
